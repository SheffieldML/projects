<p>Machine learning has had wide success in application over the last
  decade, with significant contributions in classification, probabilistic
  modelling and analysis of structured data. Over the next decade we
  expect significant progress in applying these machine learning models
  to very large data sets (on the order of millions or billions of examples,
  <i>e.g.</i> web based corpora). Improving the scalability of machine
  learning methods is a very active area of research (see, <i>e.g.</i>, this <a href="#Bottou:lskm07">book</a>).
  We think of these methods as <i>large data learning</i>. These methods
  will prove to be very valuable, but in this work we will be focussing
  on the other end of the spectrum. In particular, we will be looking
  at <i>small data learning</i>, by which we mean data sets which are
  small <i>relative</i> to the complexity of the system from which they
  are derived. Examples of this type of data include:

  <ul>
    <li> human motion data --- whilst a large amount of motion capture data
      is available (millions of frames), the total amount of data relative
      to the number of possible `natural' human motions is small. </li>

    <li> Systems biology measurements --- high throughput genetic technologies
      allow us to measure many thousands of chemical species simultaneously.
      A major task of systems biology can be characterised as &quot;system
      identification&quot; --- or from the machine learning perspective &quot;model
      selection&quot;. However, the sample rate of the data is typically much
      smaller than is used in classical systems identification (a typical
      experiment would be one sample an hour for twelve hours, or one sample
      a day for two weeks). The situation is further complicated by the
      relative difficulty of making fine system disturbances to better characterise
      system behaviour.</li>

    <li>Computational Health Informatics --- the increasing availability of
      high resolution single nucleotype polymorphism (SNP) arrays for assessing
      the genetic background of populations, in common with the availability
      of environmental information in a range of disease studies (in Manchester
      we have access to studies on asthma and diabetes) should allow resolution
      of the confounding genetic/environmental causes of disease. However,
      disease mechanisms can be highly complex and data sets typically might
      include over a thousand features for each subject for a total of only
      500 subjects.</li>
  </ul>

<p>These data are representative of a growing number of application areas
  where the number of features is large (high dimensional data) and
  the number of data points is relatively small. Additionally, for example
  in the case of the medical and computational health applications,
  there may be many additional variables that effect the system but
  are unobserved. 

<p>This type of data is sometimes known in statistics as large <i>p</i> small
  <i>n</i>, where <i>p</i> represents the dimensionality of the feature space
  and <i>n</i> the number of data points.In this
  domain there are two key problems with purely data driven approaches.
  Firstly, if data is scarce relative to the complexity of the model
  we may be unable to make accurate predictions on test data. The second
  problem also applies for larger <i>n</i>. When a model is forced to extrapolate,
  <i>i.e.</i> make predictions in a regime in which data has not yet
  been seen, the absence of a sensible physical foundation for a system
  can lead to poor performance. One major advantage of dealing with
  a physically well characterised system is that it enables accurate
  prediction even in regions where there may be no available training
  data, for example Pioneer space probes have been able to enter different
  extra terrestrial orbits despite the absence of data for these orbits.}

<p>Turning to a purely mechanistic approach does leaves us with a different
  set of problems. In particular, accurate description of a complex
  system through a mechanistic modelling paradigm such as differential
  equations can lead to an extremely complex model. Identifying and
  specifying all the interactions may not be feasible and we are still
  faced with the problem of how to parameterise the system.

<p>In this project we advocate an alternative approach.
  We will augment traditional machine learning approaches with mechanistic
  systems models. Our main algorithmic tool will be the Gaussian process,
  and the focus of our mechanistic models will be differential equations.
  We will refer to the resulting models as <i>convolution processes</i>.
  Rather than relying on an exclusively mechanistic or data driven approach
  we propose a hybrid system which involves a (typically overly simplistic)
  mechanistic model of the system which can easily be augmented through
  machine learning techniques. 

<p>Progress so far is:

  <ul>
    <li>We have a suite of methods for improving the efficiency of
      Convolutional Gaussian Processes (see
      this <a href="#Alvarez:convolved08">NIPS Paper</a> and the MULTIGP
      software below. Two further publications are expected soon)</li>
    <li>We have shown how latent force models can be applied in first order, second order and spatial differential equations using applications in computational biology, finance and geostatistics (see this <a href="#Alvarez:lfm09">AISTATS Paper</a>).</li>
  </ul>
