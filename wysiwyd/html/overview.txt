<p>WYSIWYD is a research project funded by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission. The project started on January 1st 2014.

<p>The What You Say Is What You Did project (WYSIWYD) will create a new transparency in human robot interaction (HRI) by allowing robots to both understand their own actions and those of humans, and to interpret and communicate these in human compatible intentional terms expressed as a language-like communication channel we call WYSIWYD Robotese (WR). WYSIWYD will advance this critical communication channel following a biologically and psychologically grounded developmental perspective allowing the robot to acquire, retain and express WR dependent on its individual interaction history.
In order to achieve transparency and communication in HRI a number of elements must be put in place: a well defined experimental paradigm, an integrated architecture for perception, cognition, action and intrinsic motivation that, among other things, provides the backbone for the acquisition of an autonomous communication structure, a mechanism of robot self that together with mirroring mechanisms allows for mind reading, an autobiographical memory that compresses data streams and develops a personal narrative of the interaction history, a conceptual space that provides for an interface from memory to linguistic structures and their expression in speech and communicative actions. WYSIWYD will deliver these components as elements of an integrated architecture WR-DAC. The WYSIWYD project will advance all these elements building on the strong track record of the project partners in robotics, cognitive science, psychology and computational neuroscience.
WYSIWYD will contribute to a qualitative change in human-robot interaction (HRI) and cooperation, unlocking new capabilities and application areas together with enhanced safety, robustness and monitoring. It is only through this step that humans will be able to trust robots: when they say what they do and do what they say.
