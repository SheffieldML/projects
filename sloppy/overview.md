This project was about learning classification decision boundaries when
careful labelling of the data set is required. It was originally
inspired by [joint work with Bernhard Schoelkopf](#Lawrence:noisy01) on
images.

Key contributions of the project were:

-   An approach to learning kernel parameters in kernel Fisher's
    discriminant described in [this JMLR paper](#Pena:fbd04).
-   An approach to semi-supervised learning in Gaussian processes which
    allows free choice of kernel, first presented in [this NIPS
    paper](#Lawrence:semisuper04).
-   An approximation for Gaussian process classification which allows
    practical learning of large data sets described in this [this NIPS
    paper](#Lawrence:ivm02).

Informal collaborations with [Michael
Jordan](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/), [Ralf
Herbrich](http://www.research.microsoft.com/~rherb) and [Matthias
Seeger](http://www.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/bs/people/seeger) were an
important part of the project.
