# ALMS Project

## Overview

Older people are still often cared for in institutional settings,
including hospitals and care homes, when the vast majority can be, and
wish to be, in their own homes. The use of technology, known as
telecare, to support formal and informal care mechanisms, and maintain
older people's quality of life in their own homes, has been widely
discussed and is now central to emerging government policy on caring for
older people.

Community alarm systems (1st generation telecare) have been around for
40 years and are in the homes of 1.6M users in the UK. 2nd generation
telecare has recently been introduced and is being provided to many of
those people who have 1st generation systems. The proposed advanced
lifestyle monitoring system is part of the 3rd generation of telecare
and will provide sophisticated monitoring of the well-being of older
people in their own home. The benefit of this LM system is that it will
provide early detection of factors likely to lead to a future
requirement for institutional care and will allow early intervention to
prevent loss of independence.

This project brings together robust clinical research on the triggers
for older people needing more care with the latest research on machine
learning to produce a means of detecting these key triggers.

Project was handed over to Guido Sanguinetti when Neil Lawrence moved to Manchester.
The project is sponsored by [NIHR Health Technology Assesment Project Ref 4933](http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=4933) and is a collaboration with [Professor Mark Hawley](http://www.shef.ac.uk/cast/people/hawley.html) of Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, [Dr Simon Brownsell](http://www.tis.bl.uk/jsp/search/person.jsp;jsessionid=F4D22FCE883FA0DCE31F3D05A30D7E8F?person=561) of Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and [Steve Sadler](http://www.tunstall.co.uk/2_4_8stevesadler.htm) of Tunstall Group Ltd.<a name="publications"></a>
