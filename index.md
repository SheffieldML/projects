Research Projects
-----------------

This is a list of research projects for the research group.

### Active Projects

-   [Deep Probabilistic](./deepprobabilistic) This is an EPSRC grant that is a collaboration with [Zoubin Ghaharamani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/), [John Quinn](http://air.ug/~jquinn/) and [CitizenMe](http://www.citizenme.com) with additional support from Amazon and Facebook. 
-   [OpenDreamKit](./opendreamkit/) This is an EU FP7 Grant with a cross Europe Collaboration.
-   [PIMS: Personal Information Management Systems.](./pims/) This is a
    Innovate UK grant in collaboration with
    [CitizenMe](http://www.citizenme.com).
-   [RADIANT: Rapid Development and Distribution of Statistical Tools
    for High-Throughput Sequencing Data](./radiant/) In this grant we
    are developing Gaussian process approaches for handling high
    throughput sequencing data with a focus on combining this data with
    other data modalities so that sequence information can be related
    to phenotype.
-   [MLPM: Machine Learning for Personalized Medicine](./mlpm/) In this
    grant we are concerned with the challenges of massively missing data
    in phenotype and relating genotype to phenotype.
-   [Linking recombinant gene sequence to protein product
    manufacturability using CHO cell genomic resources](./recombinant/)
    One post-doctoral research assistant. In this grant we are using
    Bayesian optimization techniques to predict improvements in protein
    production efficiency given sequence information from Chinese
    Hamster Ovary Cells.
-   [WYSIWYD: What You Say is What You Did](./wysiwyd/) One
    post-doctoral research assistant. In this grant we are developing
    approaches for deep Gaussian process models and efficient approaches
    for fitting them to large data (including streaming data).

### Past Projects

-   [BIOPREDYN: New Bioinformatics Methods and Tools for Data-Driven,
    Predictive Dynamic Modelling in Biotechnological
    Applications](./biopredyn/) One post-doctoral research assistant. In
    this grant we are focused on introducing mechanistic aspects to
    machine learning models in application to dynamical
    biological systems.
-   [SYNERGY: Systems approach to gene regulation biology through
    nuclear receptors](./synergy/)
-   [ITERATIVE: An iterative pipeline of computational modelling and experimental design for uncovering gene regulatory networks in vertebrates](./iterative/)
-   [Latent Force Models: Mechanistically Inspired Convolution Processes
    for Learning](./mechanistic/)
-   [TIGRE: Gaussian Process Models for Systems Identification with
    Applications in Systems Biology](./tigre/) (PI)
-   [PUMA: Improved processing of microarray data with probabilistic
    models](./pipeline/) (PI)
-   [Dimensional Reduction and Style IK](./motion/) (PI)
-   [Advanced Lifestyle Monitoring Systems](./alms/) (co-I)
-   [Learning Classifiers from Sloppily Labelled Data](./sloppy/) (PI)
