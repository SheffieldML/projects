<p>This project was a pump priming project concerning large scale learning of human motion capture data sets using latent variable models, in particular the GP-LVM. The aim of the project is to develop the dimensionality reduction methods for modelling human motion with a view towards constructing systems for markerless motion capture. 

<p>The achievements in the project were:
<ul>
<li>We have developed a set of tools for loading MOCAP data into MATLAB (see software below).</li>
<li>We now have convergent sparse GP-LVM for sparse learning, details are given in the large scale learning paper below.</li>
<li>We have developed a hierarchical model for decomposition of the component parts of human motion (see the Hierarchical GP-LVM paper below).</li>
<li>We have developed a shared latent space model for jointly learning about joint angles and silhouettes (see the MLMI paper below).</li>
<li>We presented a paper on extensions of the shared latent space model (see the second MLMI paper below).</li>
<li>We presented a paper on topological extensions of the model that allow different styles to be interpolated (see ICML paper below, this was an international collaboration with MIT, Toronto and `Berkeley).</li>
</ul>
