We present a novel methodology for human motion analysis and
classification. Our methodology is based on transforming motion
sequences into a form that is amenable to learning methods and
then applying kernel leaning for classification and analysis. We
measure similarity between the sequences by applying kernel
functions that have been proved effective in text classification
and bio-information namely word kernels and string kernels. We use
support vector machines for performing one-class and multi-class
classification in the context of human motion. We evaluated our
methodology on motion capture data.
