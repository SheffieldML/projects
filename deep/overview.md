The future information infrastructure will be characterized by massive
streaming sets of distributed data-sources.  These data will challenge
classical statistical and machine learning methodologies both from a
computational and a theoretical perspective. This proposal
investigates a flexible class of models for learning and inference in
the context of these challenges. We will develop learning
infrastructures that are powerful, flexible and 'privacy aware' with a
user-centric focus. These learning infrastructures will be developed
in the context of particular application challenges, including mental
health, the developing world and personal information
management.
