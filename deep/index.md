# Deep Project

## Overview

The future information infrastructure will be characterized by massive
streaming sets of distributed data-sources.  These data will challenge
classical statistical and machine learning methodologies both from a
computational and a theoretical perspective. This proposal
investigates a flexible class of models for learning and inference in
the context of these challenges. We will develop learning
infrastructures that are powerful, flexible and 'privacy aware' with a
user-centric focus. These learning infrastructures will be developed
in the context of particular application challenges, including mental
health, the developing world and personal information
management. 


The project is sponsored by [EPSRC Project Ref EP/N014162/1](http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N014162/1) and [Facebook Faculty Award Project Ref ](Deep Probabilistic Models for Making Sense of Unstructured Data) and [AWS in Education Grant award Project Ref ](Deep Probabilistic Models for Making Sense of Unstructured Data),  and is a collaboration with [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) of The University of Cambridge, [John Quinn](http://air.ug/~jquinn/) of Makerere University and Pulse Lab Kampala, [StJohn Deakins](http://www.citizenme.com/) of CitizenMe and [NewMind Network](http://www.informatics.manchester.ac.uk/NewMind/Pages/default.aspx) of .
