Currently, biologists are collecting enormous amounts of 'omics' data in a vast number of different databases. There is a great need for the integration and exploitation of these data sets to gain biological insight. This can only be achieved through the development of methods for rigorous and systematic data-driven model building, model validation, and analysis, which can handle this level of complexity.

Such methods are currently being developed by a number of academic research groups, but their wider application---especially in an industrial biotechnology context---is seriously hampered by the lack of standardisation and powerful, easy-to-use, reliable software tools.

This project aims at resolving this issue, by bringing together academic labs that manage large databases and develop cutting-edge model-building, analysis, and optimisation algorithms with small- and medium-sized enterprises that can implement these tools in a consistent, well-supported software framework and apply them to relevant biotechnological applications. Such collaboration between algorithm developers and biotechnology companies will facilitate the transfer of information and code from an academic setting to commercial applications, and will thereby strengthen European competitiveness in the fields of systems biology and biotechnological production processes based on engineered biological systems.
