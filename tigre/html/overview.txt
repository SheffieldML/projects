<p>Our goal in this project was to develop and apply new methods for
inferring the parameters of mechanistic models of biological systems
and to apply these methods to uncover the mechanisms of
transcriptional regulation. This goal was be achieved by unifying two
disparate approaches to network analysis: the systems biology approach
of specifying differential equation models of transcription (see this
<a href="#Alon:systems06">book</a>), and the statistical/machine
learning approach of constructing probabilistic models of the data
(see Related Papers below). 

Our approach was to infer the parameters of
differential equation models through constructing probabilistic models
which respect the relationships specified by the differential
equation. This was achieved by combining information from
gene expression time series data with differential equation models of
transcriptional regulation. The advantage of using probabilistic
models is that we can simultaneously handle uncertainty in the model
parameters along with experimental and biological noise.

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ol> 
<li>Process the expression data from the Drosophila blastoderm
and construct differential equation models of the underlying processes
by generalising equations developed previously by Jaeger et al.

<p>The expression data processing and development of the models was undertaken at the Nottingham site. The Manchester site developed models for mesoderm development in Drosophila whilst awaiting the data and in recent submissions (Titsias et al, PLoS Computational Biology, under review) have developed the Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework for inference in these models and a linearization of the model with initial conditions determined by Gaussian processes (Alvarez et al, TPAMI, submission imminent). </p>
</li>

<li>Adapt the preliminary work to account for non-linear response models and more complicated network motifs.We will expand the Gaussian process methodology we have developed beyond the single input module motif. We will consider other network motifs such as feed forward loops and dense overlapping regions. We will integrate transcriptional delays within the model.

<p>The nonlinear framework under review allows for time delays and multiple input transcription factors. The framework relies on the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach described in <a href="#Titsias:mcmcgp11">this NIPS paper</a> and <a href="#Titsias:mcmcgp11">this book chapter</a>.


</li>


<li> Develop Monte Carlo Sampling methods We will develop the Monte Carlo methods, both as a gold standard for comparison with our approximations and as a practical approach for parameter inference.

<p> We developed Monte Carlo approaches and an approach based on the Laplace approximation. For the non-linear models the Monte Carlo approach proved efficient enough to act as a practical substitute for the Laplace approximation. Implementation was also easier as the second order derivatives for the Monte Carlo approach are not required.
</li>


<li>Variational Approximations: We will develop and validate Gaussian process variational approximations for the systems of interest. Such approximations are typically faster than Monte Carlo sampling and are far easier to monitor as far as convergence is concerned.

<p>We developed a range of variational approximations for Gaussian process models derived from differential equations. These techniques also apply more genericaly to multiple output Gaussian processes. They included <a href="#Alvarez:convolved08">this NIPS paper</a>, <a href="#Titsias:variational09">this AISTATS paper</a>, <a href="#Alvarez:computationally11">this JMLR paper</a> and <a href="#Alvarez:efficient10">this AISTATS paper</a>.  
</li>

<li>Validation of Techniques Against Drosophila data: We will develop models of the gap gene network involved in the blastoderm development stage of Drosophila. Parameter inference in these models will be undertaken by the methodologies developed in the objectives above. Since the protein concentrations are known in this Drosophila system it can be used as a validation data set for the techniques we develop.

<p>In our <a href="#Honkela:modelbased10">PNAS paper</a> we validated our techniques against ChIP-chip studies on Drosophila mesoderm. Our latest studies in preparation and review are also being compared to the Drosophila mesoderm, as well as the blastoderm.</li>

<h3>Highlighted Achievements</h3>
<ul>

<li>We developed an approach to ranking targets of a transcription factor through a linear differential models of transcription and translation. (see DISIMRANK software below, this <a href="#Honkela:modelbased10">PNAS paper</a> and <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/2.6/bioc/html/tigre.html">this Bioconductor package</a>).</li>

<li>We provided software implementations of our algorithms for linear response through <a href="http://www.bioconductor.org">Bioconductor</a> as the TIGRE package.</li>

<li>We developed an approach to inferring protein concentration given the
gene expression of known targets in a single input motif. (see GPSIM
software below, this <a href="#Lawrence:transcriptionalGP06">NIPS
paper</a> and this <a href="#Gao:latent08">ECCB paper</a>).</li>

<li>We developed a range of approaches for efficient computation in multiple-output Gaussian process models. The first relied on conditional independence assumptions (see this <a
href="#Alvarez:convolved08">NIPS paper</a> and this <a href="#Alvarez:computationally11">JMLR paper</a>).</li>

<li>We pioneered a new class of approximation techniques for Gaussian processes in general based on a variational approximation to the posterior. We showed how this could be done for single output Gaussian processes with a <href="#Titsias:variational09">NIPS paper and how the approach could be extended to multiple output Gaussian processes with an <a href="#Alvarez:efficient10">AISTATS paper</a>.

<li>For non-linear response models we showed how sampling can be done efficiently using Gaussian
processes even when the posterior over the GP is strongly correlated
(see this <a href="#Titsias:efficient08">NIPS paper</a> and this <a href="#Titsias:mcmcgp11">book chapter</a>)</li>

<li>With collaborators we composed a <a href="#Lawrence:licsb10">collected volume</a> of papers in this area.

<li>We were invited to contribute to two further collected volumes, one on Bayesian inference in time series models and the other is the imminent "Handbook of Systems Biology" edited by Mark Girolami and Michael Stumpf and soon to be published by Springer.

<li>We organized four workshops, three in a new series "Learning and Inference in Computational Systems Biology" and one in "Machine Learning in Systems Biology".</li>

<li>The EPSRC funding covered a post-doctoral researcher in Manchester and a year's post-doctoral research in Nottingham. This was augmented by a visitor from Finland, funded by the EU under the FP7 PASCAL2 Network of Excellence and a PhD student funded by the School of Computer Science at the University of Manchester.

<li>Three follow on grants have so far been awarded which depend in some part the ideas developed in this project. Two from the BBSRC (Grant numbers BB/H018123/2 and BB/I004769/2, the second of which is a Europe-wide consortium under the ERASysBio Plus scheme) and one from the EU under FP7: "BioPreDyn-From Data to Models: New Bioinformatics Methods and Tools for Data-Driven Predictive Dynamic Modelling in Biotechnological Applications".</li>
