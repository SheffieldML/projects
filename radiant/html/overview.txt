<p>RADIANT is a research project funded by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission.The project started in December 2012 and brings together ten project partners from five European countries.

<p>The aim of the RADIANT project is to develop new statistical analysis tools for solving open problems in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data analysis. HTS is a rapidly evolving family of technologies with many applications, including genetics of both rare and common diseases, understanding disease mechanism progression. RADIANT aims to provide an integrated computational framework for HTS data analysis that is robust and user-friendly, and provide tools to benchmark experimental protocols and statistical methods. The project will establish training materials and an extensive training programme for the rapid dissemination of these new tools to the biomedical community.
